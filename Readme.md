## A Web App For Exploring Spotify Data ![](https://travis-ci.org/goldensunliu/graphql-spotify-example.svg?branch=master)
This is an example web application built using [GraphQL Spotify](https://github.com/goldensunliu/graphql-spotify) + [React/Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) + [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) + [Spotify Web API](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) 

* It comes complete with a simple and complete implicit Auth flow for access Spotify's data

* You can use this as a skeleton for your next SSR single page web app powered by [GraphQL Spotify](https://github.com/goldensunliu/graphql-spotify)

* It is a great showchase on how you can request all the data you need from Spotify with a single request in your applications!

****[Deployed Example Here](https://graph-spotify-example-gzsqbkpmqv.now.sh)****

#### Routes

* /graphiql - An in-browser IDE for exploring GraphQL Spotify Data
* /categories - An server side rendering example page built on top of [React/Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) + [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)
